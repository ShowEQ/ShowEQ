----------

1) Net Layer problems with opcodes like 0x??00
Opcodes that end in 00 (i.e. OP_BazaarSearch or OP_ConsentDeny right now) will
be falsely identified as net opcodes and not processed. You will see a message
on the console, but this is harmless. Unless you are doing stuff with bazaar
searches (which I don't think even works right now), this will not impact
your showeq session.
