1) Multiple EQ Clients on the Same Box

Running showeq to monitor an EQ client on a machine which has multiple EQ
clients running on it can result in crashes and mixed sessions. It is possible
that if both EQ clients zone at the same time, showeq can mix up the sessions
resulting in either showeq swapping which session it is watching or something
crashes resulting from processing both clients at the same time. Using session
tracking might help, but there is no workaround at this time to make showeq work
properly in this configuration.
