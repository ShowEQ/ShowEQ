ShowEQ Version 4 Frequently Asked Questions

FIXME: table of contents :)


1) Hit points always say 65536, 0, 100, etc, what is wrong

ShowEQ does not recieve hit point numbers from the client as it once did.  
We now only recieve a percentage of hit points, and only when you are close
to the mob.  Before you get close enough the the mob, HP will reflect 65536
or 0, which tells you you need to get closer.


2) Why wont ShowEQ show me the loot my mob will drop

Loot is not sent to your client until after you right click on its corpse.
There is no guaranteed way of determining loot.  However, if your mob will
carry the item he drops, you can narrow the possiblity by checking the type
of model armor/weapons he carries, although this may not reflect at all on
what is actually dropped.


3) My faction is broken!  It used to tell me my faction numbers when i 
   conned someone, now i get a number like 4 or 1.  

Faction, just like HP, is sent in a representative value, rather than real
value.  You are now only sent a number that reflects your faction status. 
ie, whether the client should print "scowls", "threatening", "dubious",
"indifferent", "ally", etc.  No more counting how many more orcs to kill
to get that kelethin faction up.


4) What happened to experience?

Just like HP and faction, we no longer are sent the actual value.  We are 
sent a number between 0 and 330 that reflects directly on how the client
should draw the experience bar.  We do however know what mob you killed
and experience formulas, so what you see in the experience window now will
be close estimates of the real exp you have.
