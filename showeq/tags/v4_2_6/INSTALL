INSTALLATION OVERVIEW:
----------------------
ShowEQ originated on Redhat 6.1, however, it will compile and
run on all newer Linux distro's. You will need the QT library
from Troll Tech (http://www.troll.no) compiled with multi-threading 
support enabled, as well as libpcap from the Lawrence Berkely National 
Laboratory (www.tcpdump.org), also the GNU database library gdbm 
(ftp.gnu.org), and pthread support (provided via glibc).  Also
it can be configured to use Berkeley DB3 instead of gdbm.

Additionally, the libEQ.a file (once included with ShowEQ) has been
removed. You must download and install this file in your compiler's
library path for ShowEQ to be able to decrypt the Everquest data stream.
ShowEQ will work without this library, but only in 'broken decode' mode.


PRE-REQUISITES:
---------------
Below is a list of packages you will need in order to compile ShowEQ:

   Name:      Minimum:  Suggested:
   -----------------------------------
   *** 3rd party libraries ***
   qt         2.3.2     (Must be compiled with -thread) (Qt 3.x is iffy!)
   qt-devel   2.3.2     (Must be compiled with -thread) (Qt 3.x is iffy!)
   libpcap    0.62
   gdbm       1.8.0

   *** Optional 3rd party libraries ***
   db3        3.2.9  3.3   

   *** C++ Compilation ***
   glibc      2.2  2.2.4
   libstdc++  3.0  3.0.2
   gcc        3.0  3.0.2

   *** GNU tools ***
   libtool    1.3.4-3   Most recent...
   autoconf   2.13-1    Most recent...
   automake   1.4-6     Most recent...
   -----------------------------------
   
NOTE: Higher versions of these libraries should work fine...
NOTE: Except for Qt 3.0.x, which currently has issues with ShowEQ.  Unless 
you are looking to debug them, avoid it.


INSTALL PROCESS:
----------------
First you must make the configure script, but after that
the basic install is the same as any other GNU package:

 make -f Makefile.dist
 ./configure
 make
 make install

This installs showeq in /usr/local/bin, and puts maps and logs in
/usr/local/share/showeq. make install is important, the program will not
find maps without it.

If you want to make the CGI files, use
 ./configure --enable-cgi=<path where cgi-bin files should reside>


CONFIGURING AND USING:
----------------------
Please note that ShowEQ requires root privileges, otherwise the pcap library
cannot be initialized and ShowEQ will fail to load... You should not use SEQ
on a computer where root access presents a security issue.

Configuration values are stored in the file showeq.xml.  This file will 
be looked for in the local directory first, then the /usr/local/share/showeq 
directory.  The contents of this file are layed out in a fairly readable form 
and comments are provided in the distributed seqdef.xml file.

Filters for 'hiding' spawns from the spawnlist and map can be configured via 
a file specified in the config file (typically 'filters.conf').  A sample 
file has been included in the distribution which should be self explanatory. 
Spawn Alert filters can also be configured here.  Improving the documentation
of alerts and filters is an area where volunteers may help a lot.
