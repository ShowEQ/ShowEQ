To Do list
----------
A full "to do" list is maintained on SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/seq) under the "Tasks" heading.

* Maintain Gentoo ebuilds for showeq and showeq-maps.
* Add version information to the XML based opcode files. Reasons:
   1. To make it easier to diagnose when people have the incorrect versions installed and being loaded from one directory or another.
   2. To support the possibility of automatic opcode file updates.
* Split packet capture front end into a seperate program that communicates with ShowEQ either via pipe (local packet capture) or TCP/SSL connection (to allow remote packet capture). Reasons:
   1. Make ShowEQ more flexible on the packet capture and network topology front.
   2. Possible support for having the seperate program be setuid root without ShowEQ being...
   3. Potential for supporting doing the package capture on a Windows box.
* Make XML configuration file based EQ Network packet structure handling.
   1. Eliminate the need to do a full new ShowEQ release every time SOE patches.
   2. To support the possibility of automatic structure file updates.
* Add the ability to automagically download updated opcode and structure configuration files. Do I really have to tell you the reason...
* Organized packet capture display with the ability to filter in/out different packets. Potentially with support of live visual structure alignment and opcode map editing.
   1. Make it easier to adapt to patches on patch day.
   2. Make it easier to figure out what different opcodes/structures are used for/contain. Thus allowing developers to more readily add support for new features based on those findings.
* More general packet system cleanup/optimization.
* Move all non-GUI related stuff out of EQInterface.
* Improved filtering system.
* Better support for map editing.
* Better support for map optimization.
* Seperate UI from data storage/handling in Combat Window and Experience Window to make them easier to maintain.
* Create new and improved item db support using sqlite/MySQL backends and the possibility to work with ksmith's eqitems database.
* Actually add a menu-item for Help if and when certain suckers, err, volunteers write some help files for ShowEQ.
* Find a sucker to write a real new INSTALL.newbies.
* Include an up-to-date FAQ with the software where it belongs.
* Coordinate with different volunteers on policies for maintaining packages for other Linux distributions (debian, Fedora, etc.).
